# Insurance-Claim-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
### The dataset contains information on the insurance claim. each observation is different policyholders with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
### Performed Feature Engineering to create important features in order to impart some added advantage to the model training.
### Trying to use the basic models to the maximum strength.
### Performed multiple combinations of hyper parmetertuning paramaters to achieve the best possible ROC-AUC score.
### Evaluation metric is ROC-AUC Score.
## ROC stands for **Receiver operator Characteristics**  is a curve that helps to visualize the performace of binary classifier. The **Area under the curve(AUC)** of the ROC curve indicates the ability of the binary cllassifier to distinguish between both the classes.
